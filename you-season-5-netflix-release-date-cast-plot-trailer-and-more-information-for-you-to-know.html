And it’s been thrilling to watch Penn bring Joe to creepy yet compelling life. We’re deeply grateful that Netflix has shown You such <a href=#>monumental support and that people around the world</a> have enjoyed watching Joe really get it all very wrong over the past 3 seasons. The whole You team is excited to explore new, dark facets of love in season 4.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Goodbye… YOU. Joe Goldberg will return for the fifth and final season of YOU in 2024. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1PIP0pRizK</a></p>— YOU (@YouNetflix) <a href=#>March 24, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>‘You’ Storyline:</span></h2><p><span>‘You’ is about a troubled man Joe Goldberg, <a href=#>who happens to be a serial killer</a>. While Joe manages a New York bookstore, he <a href=#>develops toxic and extreme affection</a> toward a customer Guinevere Beck. Subsequently, as his obsession grows for Beck, Joe becomes more desperate. As a result of this, Joe will <a href=#>do anything to put himself in the life</a> of Beck, no matter the cost.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/you-season-3-plot.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>‘You’ Season 5 Release Date: When will it premier?</span></h2><p><span>While the official date is not confirmed. Initially, ‘You’ season 5 is <a href=#>definitely coming in late or mid 2024 </a>as it complicated due to writers strike, as stated by Netflix. So we are not sure of the precise time the <a href=#>series will drop to the screen next year.</a></span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, there is c<a href=#>onfirmed development – the book release of the series</a> titled ‘YOU</span>‘ is publiched and check the whole series<span>. If you love to read, you can pick this up when it is available.</span></p><p>However, Joe and his companion Love Quinn portrayed by Victoria Pedretti&nbsp;will enter a new chapter in their relationship in Season 4 of You, which will <a href=#>premiere on Netflix on March 9, 2023.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>‘You’ Season 5 Cast: Who will make a comeback?</span></h2><p><span>Some of the cast is</span> <a href=#>definitely coming back as they have added some intriguing twists</a><span> to the series. We are certainly going to have Penn Badgley (Joe) and Victoria Pedretti (Love) back – there is still more between these two. As for the rest of the cast, there is a lot that can change. However, we <a href=#>expect some members of the cast</a> in the previous season to come back and we have them on our list. We can also expect a few new faces in the cast. Possibly, to explore a new twist that will surely be added to the story.</span></p><p><span>Here is a list of the expected cast:&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>‘You’ season 5 Expected Plot: What will happen?</span></h2><p><span><a href=#>Extracting from what we have seen in season 4</a> of ‘You’, there are so many cliffhangers around. Season four gives something else that differs from season one, with Joe left in a position where he doesn’t want to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hence, there will be exciting twists in season 5 of the series. Especially, something is definitely going to cook up. While there are things to unravel between Joe and Love, a <a href=#>new target appears for</a> Joe. Here we know Joe is back to himself again. What this will bring about might not help Joe, and things might just not go accordingly as usual.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>‘You’ Season 5 Trailer: When can we see it?</span></h2><p><span>With the <a href=#>no confirmed date of the premiere for season 5 </a>around 2024, Netflix has yet to launched official trailer of You Season 5.

On <a href=#>IMDb, it gets a solid 7.7/10</a>, and on Rotten Tomatoes, it <a href=#>gets 92% on the Tomatometer and 61% on the audience score.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Can I Watch You Season 4 Episodes?</h2><p>The hit series You is a Netflix production, and it is <a href=#>available on the official Netflix app</a>.
