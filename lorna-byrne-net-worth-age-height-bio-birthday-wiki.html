She maintains that God and the angels would like all religions to worship together, each according to their own understanding, none trying to convert the others. “It needs to become normal for all of us, regardless of our education, our status in life or our method or place of prayer, to come together with open hearts — without any agenda — to pray to God in whatever way feels appropriate to us.”</p><p align=justify>Angels in My Hair is her memoir of her early marriage and life.&nbsp;Stairways to Heaven (2010) tells the story of her life after her husband’s death, including how she wrote her first book and became a well-known public figure.&nbsp;It contains details about angels working in the world, she states.&nbsp;The Angels’ Message of Hope is about the importance of hope in these difficult times.&nbsp;Love from Heaven discussed the issue of “lack of love” in today’s world.

Since we are appallingly ignorant about the nature of consciousness, it is premature to dismiss these reports as fantasies, which is too often done. Lorna Byrne’s ‘Angels in my Hair’ is captivating.
