<time>07 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Here at CelebMix, we love YouTubers. They never fail to make us laugh, smile and cry with their original content and we just can’t get enough of the variety available at the click of a button.</p><p>In fact, we love YouTubers so much that we’ve decided to celebrate the best of the internet with you, in our new ‘YouTuber of the Week’ feature! Each week, we will award one YouTuber with this coveted title, and let you know why you should be watching their videos.</p><p>Who better to be crowned our first ever YouTuber of the Week, than the girl bawse herself, <strong>Lilly Singh</strong> aka IISuperwomanII!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/youtuber-of-the-week-lilly-singh-iisuperwomanii-03.gif alt="Lilly Singh" width=500 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Who is Lilly Singh?</h3><p>Lilly Singh is an Indo-Canadian YouTuber, vlogger, comedian and all-round girl bawse, better known as&nbsp;IISuperwomanII.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/youtuber-of-the-week-lilly-singh-iisuperwomanii-01.gif alt="lilly singh" width=308 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Lilly joined YouTube in 2010 and has since&nbsp;garnered over&nbsp;<a href=#>9 million subscribers!</a>&nbsp;Whilst Lilly makes fans laugh and smile with her funny videos, she initially used her YouTube channel as a creative outlet to help her overcome&nbsp;depression. Whilst she still suffers from bad days, Lilly hopes that her videos will help others too. In an interview with <a href=#>People</a>, Lilly said:&nbsp;“People ask how I got out of my depression, and I don’t know. Something in my brain just switched.&nbsp;Now I hope my videos can be a switch for someone.”</p><p>Her upbeat and positive videos are a hit with fans across the globe, and in turn&nbsp;has enabled Lilly to achieve some incredible things since she started her channel. Earlier&nbsp;this year, she released a&nbsp;YouTube Red feature film called&nbsp;A Trip To Unicorn Island. The film documented Lilly’s first world tour and featured intakes from friends, family and famous personalities that have inspired her (including Dwayne Johnson, who FYI is the literal love of Lilly’s life).&nbsp;&nbsp;She revealed that ‘Unicorn Island’ is her happy place where&nbsp;she decides “Everything’s going to be okay, and I’m happy because life is great”.</p><p>Lilly is more than just your average YouTuber. She has&nbsp;<a href=#>partnered up with Smashbox</a> to release a red liquid lipstick called ‘BAWSE’, and has filmed two cameos for the&nbsp;Bad Moms and Ice Age: Collision Course&nbsp;movies. Additionally, she was featured in Fast Company Magazine as one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business. Lilly’s an all-round inspiring, humble and hard working individual, who is living the dream every day.</p><h3>Why should you&nbsp;watch Lilly’s videos?</h3><p>If positive, hilarious and <a href=#>relatable</a> videos are your thing, then Lilly is the YouTuber for you. Lilly posts content twice a week, and also has a <a href=#>second channel</a> where she vlogs daily. If you subscribe to Lilly’s IISuperwomanII channel, you can expect to see plenty of skits, parodies, rants, ‘types of people’ videos, collaborations and positivity in abundance. You may also see some of her ‘family members’ pop up from time to time!</p><p>What you quickly learn from Lilly’s channel, is that she is a regular person just like us. Okay, so we may not have 9 million subscribers supporting our every movement. However, we always pick food over people,&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;is our kryptonite and we fangirl better than the rest, just like Lilly does!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/youtuber-of-the-week-lilly-singh-iisuperwomanii-02.gif alt="YouTuber of the Week: Lilly Singh (IISuperwomanII) 2" width=245 height=245 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>With Lilly, you get an honest insight into her life. Whether it be first thing in the morning, exhausted and without make up, or seeing her getting glammed up for an event, she is not afraid to show her viewers every aspect of the crazy world of Lilly Singh, particularly on her second channel. This is one of the reasons why we love her so much and find her so relatable.</p><p>If you need further convincing as to why you should give Lilly’s videos a go, here’s five of her many must-watch videos!</p><h3>1. How Girls Get Ready</h3><p>With over 19 million views, this is Lilly’s most viewed video on YouTube. Anyone who’s ever tried to get ready for a night out, party or general dress up situation will relate to the struggles in this video. How come it’s so difficult to find an outfit, get your make up right and perfect your twerk?!</p><p></p><h3>2. My Parents Reacting to Anaconda</h3><p>Lilly, in her Nicki Minaj t-shirt (waddup t-shirt reference!), introduces this hilarious video of her ‘parents’ reacting to the ‘Anaconda’ music video. Lilly’s ‘dad’ is high key expecting something similar to The Jungle Book, whilst her ‘mum’ admits to being a fan of Nicki’s ‘Starships’. It’s safe to say that neither of them expect what they’re about to see&nbsp;during&nbsp;‘Anaconda’ though, making this a hilarious, must-watch video!</p><p></p><h3>3.&nbsp;A Diss Track Against Myself (Roast Yourself Challenge)</h3><p>YouTuber Ryan Higa recently started a <a href=#>‘Roast Yourself’ challenge</a>, and nominated some of his fellow YouTubers to roast themselves. Lilly was one of his&nbsp;nominees, and she responded by roasting herself like a pro. Superwoman went in hard on herself, but proved that she’s got an epic sense of humour!</p><p></p><h3>4. The #GirlLove Challenge</h3><p>At the end of last year, Lilly launched the #GirlLove challenge, in a bid to crack down on girl-on-girl hate. Joined by a whole host of fellow females including Shay Mitchell, Grace Helbig and Colleen Ballinger Evans, Lilly encouraged her viewers to build girls up instead of tearing them down. It’s great to see someone use their platform to spread positivity, and following the release of this video,&nbsp;the hashtag #GirlLove was spread all over social media. Better still,&nbsp;all revenue from the #GirlLove&nbsp;video was&nbsp;donated to the Malala Fund in support of educating girls around the world!</p><p></p><h3>5. The Time I Met The Rock</h3><p>This is hands down one of the best Lilly videos and one of the many reasons why we adore her so much. As we mentioned earlier, Lilly LOVES Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, and back in 2015 she got to meet him for the first time. She vlogged the whole thing, and her reaction before, during and after meeting her idol is SO precious. ‘I CAN’T’ is the most used phrase during this vlog, and quite frankly we share her speechlessness and we simultaneously smiled, laughed and cried watching her meet Dwayne! They’re pretty much BFF’s now, which is the most adorable thing – dreams really do come true. This vlog is so raw and real, and anyone who’s ever met their idol will be able to relate to this.</p><p></p><p>Thank you Lilly for being so funny, inspiring and real – this is why you’re&nbsp;our first YouTuber of the Week!
