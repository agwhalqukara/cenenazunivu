He once held the job as a vacuum cleaner salesman. He was a member of the Black Panther Party (BPP) during the 1960s and 70s. Later, he left the party and started a job in the photography business. He worked as an aerial photojournalist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution during the 1980s.</p><p>His remarkable work includes a portrait of poet and civil rights activist <strong>Maya Angelou</strong>, photos of the Rev. <strong>Ralph David Abernathy</strong>, and photos of President <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong> in 1983.
