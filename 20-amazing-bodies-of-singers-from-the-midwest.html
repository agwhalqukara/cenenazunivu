She works with personal trainer, Craig Smith, to help her stay in shape. "Madonna does five to six workouts weekly that vary on a daily basis and focus on a variety of methods and training modalities," Smith revealed in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour</span></a><span>. "Her workouts include dance, resistance training, interval training, yoga, barre workouts, Pilates, aerobics, athletic conditioning, and circuit training."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1770748968.jpg><p><span>Haley Reinhart is originally from Wheeling, Illinois. She tells</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> Forbes</span></a><span> that she wants to be a source of positivity for others. "</span><span>I feel like I have several callings and one of them is to be a light warrior for whoever I can reach. There's a lot of people out there who are told even to feel sadder than they have to be. Like s**t's bad enough. So I'm trying to overcome what I'm dealing with, spread love and peace however cliche it sounds. That is the bottom line message for everything that I've put out. So I'd rather focus on that; help people reach their higher selves, their higher consciousness, and just focus on that especially at the shows. When we're together, I feel that energy bouncing back and forth. It depends what kind of energy you want to put out there, but I'd rather be uplifting powerfully.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-2150886566.jpg><p><span>Sheryl Crow is originally from Missouri.

Crow likes to practice meditation. </span><span>"One of the things that has changed my life—and this comes from someone who was highly self-critical and a type-A personality—is meditating. The simple act of making my brain shut off for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes at night may not seem like much, but what ends up happening, besides creating space in your day, is your awake posture begins to replicate your meditative posture</span><span>."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-2152520047.jpg><p><span>Jennifer Hudson is from Illinois.

"This Olay moisturizer takes care of everything: It moisturizes and delivers retinol, so it keeps skin hydrated and plump. It's a great price, too, for everything you're getting. It's been a huge part of my regimen. I started using retinol a few years ago — I can't remember exactly when — and have been very consistent with it. I haven't stopped because it really makes a big difference in my skin."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-2151899740.jpg><p><span>Janelle Monae is originally from Kansas. She shared how her performance schedule affects what she needs to eat to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Bon Appetit</span></a><span>. "</span><span>Because our shows are so high energy, if I eat too close to performing I can get a cramp. So I try to eat maybe three hours before.

She is a member of the LGBTQ community, and talked about coming out in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Buzzfeed.</span></a><span> "I didn't care what people thought, and I came out no matter what the consequences were gonna be. And then, after I did, it was as if a weight lifted, and the world was just a better place. It was just more colorful and more love, and so many people supported me. I feel like they love me even more, which was great because I was scared. But you know, I met somebody that inspired me to not give a fuck, actually. I wanted the world to know [that] I'm in love with this woman — like, I want to hold her hand in public. I had never been able to be publicly affectionate with anybody or anything like that. So it was just a good, good feeling. I felt like a snake that shed his skin and got some new skin."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1783221713.jpg><p><span>Sara Evans is originally from Missouri.

"We're kind of food snobs — not in the sense that we eat fancy food, but just that we don't like restaurant food that much," says Evans. "So I like to try to cook at least three nights a week, just to feel better about myself as a mom. And it's much less expensive, you know what you're getting, you know what you're feeding them."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1529423098.jpg><p><span>Ava Max was born in Milwaukee. She shared her favorite essentials in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>GQ</span></a><span>. Max loves pistachios as a healthy snack option. "I feel like I'm always hungry. And lately I've been trying like the whole gluten free diet. And so I don't have crackers anymore on me. So I always have some kind of nuts. That sounds so weird. Some kind of nut, but pistachios in my bag. Unshelled, unsalted. If they're too salty then my cheeks go from like left to right. Like I just look like, you know. Pistachios are my jam."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1968512687.jpg><p><span>SZA is from St. Louis, Missouri. She revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Refinery29</span></a><span> that she likes to use natural skincare products. "I have to choose products that I can find in nature. I have cystic acne, so I use a Manuka honey mask to combat it and hemp oil to smooth out the surface of my skin. I also use a Vitamin C serum and black soap, and that's it. If I go to the dermatologist and get a peel, she prescribes me shit after, but I don't use it. My skin goes crazy, and I break out."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-2088112410.jpg><p><span>Betty Who spent a portion of her childhood in Michigan. In an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Schon Magazine</span></a><span>, she talked about her life and career. "I think I spent a lot of time in the early years of my career trying to learn how to be in the business. I always knew how to write songs and sing – that's never been the thing I needed help with. I've gotten better as I've honed my craft, but the thing I had no idea how to do was be a successful business person. How could I have? I was 21 when I signed my record deal with Sony. There has been a lot of trial and error, and a lot of that had to do with my identity: I was writing music to serve this greater entity that was my business as opposed to trying to be an artist and lean into the creative part of me."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1462899302.jpg><p><span>Taylor Momsen is originally from Missouri.

She shared where her inspirations come from in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Alt Press</span></a><span>. "</span><span>I am super inspired and impacted creatively just by traveling in general, so any time I would visit a place for a couple of weeks, it would change my perspective. So definitely moving and just being surrounded by different things every day and meeting new people who listen to different kinds of music, I know that it's had a huge influence just based on the things I'm writing about and the things I see every day."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1668632579.jpg><p><span>Janet Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana.
