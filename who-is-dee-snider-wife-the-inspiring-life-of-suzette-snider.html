<time>31 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Suzette Snider, who is married to Dee Snider, has been doing make-up and designing costumes for him for over 40 years.</p><p>She is credited with making his wild stage persona, which included a lot of makeup, spandex outfits, and crazy hairstyles.</p><p>The couple has been together for more than 40 years and has four children.</p><p>But Suzette’s life hasn’t always been about rock and roll. When she was growing up, she lived in a place where drug use was common, and she saw how it hurt her family.</p><p>So, she decided to live a “straight-edge” life, which means she doesn’t use drugs or drink.</p><p>Even though Suzette was determined to live a drug-free life, she still had problems with her <a href=#>mental health</a>.</p><p>After losing three close family members and feeling sad, she was diagnosed with clinical depression and found it hard to take the medicine her doctor gave her.</p><p>But she eventually found comfort in spiritual readings and, more recently, in plant-based medicine in a controlled retreat setting.</p><p>Dee Snider is best known as the lead singer for the band Twisted Sister. He is married to Suzette. Snider was on the popular TV show “The Masked Singer” not too long ago.</p><p>He played the character Doll, who wore a mask with a button for an eye and a stapled-shut mouth.</p><p>He wore a dress and high heels to finish off the look. During her performance, Dee sang “Jailhouse Rock” while dancers with popcorn hats moved around her.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dee-snider-doll-in-The-Masked-Singer-683x1024-1.jpg alt="dee snider wife age,suzette snider,dee snider net worth,what is dee sniders real name,is dee snider still alive,dee snider daughter,dee snider young,what is dee snider&amp;#039;s real name,suzette snider young,dee snider&amp;#039;s wife suzette,dee snider wife young,dee snider wife age difference,dee snider wife plastic surgery,dee snider wife height,dee snider wife photos,dee snider wife family feud,twisted sister dee snider wife,how old is dee snider&amp;#039;s wife,how old is dee snider&amp;#039;s wife suzette,pictures of dee snider&amp;#039;s wife" width=342 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Even though he got the lowest score, he ended his performance by singing his hit song “We’re Not Going to Take It,” which made the crowd very happy.</p><p>The show’s judges also dressed up in costumes that went with the theme of the WB movie of the night.</p><p>Dandelion was the second act of the night. He wore a green outfit with a big flower on his head. She sang “Over the Rainbow” and had clues about working with Madonna, Flea, and Elton John, as well as a tornado and an apple.</p><p>Even though the judges had different ideas about who Dandelion was, they all liked how she did.</p><h3>Everything you need to know about Dee Snider wife, Suzette</h3><p>Suzette Snider was born on September 16, 1960, in Long Island, New York, to an Italian Catholic family.</p><p>As of 2022, Dee Snider’s wife will be 62 years old.</p><p>Her childhood was not easy because her parents got a divorce and both of her brothers were in trouble with the law and drugs.</p><p>In the span of five years, Suzette’s mother died from illness, one of her brothers killed himself, and another brother, Vincent Gargiulo, was killed.</p><p>Suzette’s skill as a costume designer was shown in the award-winning movie “Fool’s Day,” which was made by her sons.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dee-snider-wife-Suzette-Snider-683x1024-1.jpg alt="dee snider wife age,suzette snider,dee snider net worth,what is dee sniders real name,is dee snider still alive,dee snider daughter,dee snider young,what is dee snider&amp;#039;s real name,suzette snider young,dee snider&amp;#039;s wife suzette,dee snider wife young,dee snider wife age difference,dee snider wife plastic surgery,dee snider wife height,dee snider wife photos,dee snider wife family feud,twisted sister dee snider wife,how old is dee snider&amp;#039;s wife,how old is dee snider&amp;#039;s wife suzette,pictures of dee snider&amp;#039;s wife" width=342 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The movie was written by Cody and Shane, and Shane also ran it.

She made the logo for the band Twisted Sister and many of her husband’s famous costumes for the stage.</p><p>Suzette is a good designer, and her daughter Cheyenne has taken up where she left off.</p><p>Cheyenne is the couple’s daughter. Like her mom, she is a designer, and like her dad, she is a “total metalhead.”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dee-snider-daughter-Cheyenne-683x1024-1.jpg alt="dee snider wife age,suzette snider,dee snider net worth,what is dee sniders real name,is dee snider still alive,dee snider daughter,dee snider young,what is dee snider&amp;#039;s real name,suzette snider young,dee snider&amp;#039;s wife suzette,dee snider wife young,dee snider wife age difference,dee snider wife plastic surgery,dee snider wife height,dee snider wife photos,dee snider wife family feud,twisted sister dee snider wife,how old is dee snider&amp;#039;s wife,how old is dee snider&amp;#039;s wife suzette,pictures of dee snider&amp;#039;s wife" width=342 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2012, they were on “Celebrity Wife Swap,” where they traded spouses with <a href=#>rapper</a> Flavor Flav and his partner, Liz Trujillo.</p><p>On April 16, 2020, Suzette celebrated the first day she met Dee by writing on social media, “You know it’s true love when you’re in quarantine and you still love each other LOL.”</p><p>Dee has said that his wife is “insanely talented” as a hairdresser, makeup artist, and stylist.</p><p>A fan asked him to hire Suzette to change their look in May 2021, but she only works with her family now, so he had to say no.</p><h3>The couple is parents to 4 kids</h3><p>Suzette and Dee Snider are proud to have four children: Jesse Blaze Snider, Shane Snider, Cody Blue Snider, and Cheyenne Snider.</p><p>Even though Dee wasn’t sure if he wanted a daughter, he couldn’t imagine life without Cheyenne, who loves metal music and fashion like he does.</p><p>Cheyenne is a model and has her own clothing line called Havoc.
