Investigators have still not released any information about a possible suspect.</p><p>Despite the lack of serious injury — as well as Murdaugh’s ability to talk to responding officers after calling 911 — he was airlifted to a local hospital by a helicopter that landed on the highway.</p><p>It was not immediately clear why such drastic action was requested for at most a superficial wound.</p><p>Local outlet FitsNews — which runs a podcast, “Murdaugh Murders” — also claimed that the disgraced lawyer’s black Mercedes had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“extended mobility tires,”</a> which would have allowed him to drive 50 miles with a flat, raising questions over why he pulled over.</p><p>The Murdaughs are one of <a href=#>South Carolina’s most prominent legal families</a>, with three generations having served consecutively as solicitor for the 14th Circuit.</p><p>Alex hit the spotlight in June after finding his wife, Maggie, 52, and son, Paul, 22, dead from multiple gunshot wounds near a kennel outside the family’s hunting lodge near Islandton.</p><p>At the time, Paul Murdaugh was <a href=#>facing trial in the death</a> of 19-year-old Mallory Beach in a crash of a boat he was reportedly manning at the time.</p><p>No one has been arrested in the double murders, which are still being investigated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), which is also probing Alex Murdaugh’s reported shooting.</p><p>After entering rehab, Murdaugh was on Wednesday also suspended from practicing law by the South Carolina Supreme Court amid the investigation into his alleged behavior at his law firm.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkaGyuXnMrqmdmaWctW60wJ1kp6ddq7a0tcGlnGahnp%2FCs8WMsJ%2Bepl2nsrG70a2gp59dnbJuw8CsZKygn6l6qrqMoZyanF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-murdaugh-had-no-visible-injury-when-reporting-he-was-shot-in-head.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falex-murdaugh-had-no-visible-injury-when-reporting-he-was-shot-in-head.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falex-murdaugh-had-no-visible-injury-when-reporting-he-was-shot-in-head.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falex-murdaugh-had-no-visible-injury-when-reporting-he-was-shot-in-head.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-murdaugh-had-no-visible-injury-when-reporting-he-was-shot-in-head.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-murdaugh-had-no-visible-injury-when-reporting-he-was-shot-in-head.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerry-seinfeld-jokes-that-eddie-murphy-wasn-t-really-an-innovator.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerry-seinfeld-jokes-that-eddie-murphy-wasn-t-really-an-innovator.html>Jerry Seinfeld Jokes That Eddie Murphy Wasnt Really An Innovator</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./7-true-facts-about-gina-carano-does-she-have-a-husband.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./7-true-facts-about-gina-carano-does-she-have-a-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
