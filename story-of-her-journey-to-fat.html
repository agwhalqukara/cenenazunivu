She previously gained weight for the show, Katie Hopkins: Journey to Fat and Back. She began by consuming 4,000 calories each day to change her slim, <strong>124-pound</strong> figure into a fat one, but she didn't gain any weight in the first two weeks since she was technically underweight for her body.<p dir=auto role=none>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Nypost,</a> after a month, she had increased her daily calorie intake to a whopping 6,500 calories equivalent to 13 meals a day. It was practically getting up and knowing that she would be having a substantial meal every two hours. It came to the point when Hopkins didn't want to wake up in the morning because she knew her day would consist of doing the thing she didn't want to do.</p><p>The far-right commentator also had to limit her movement to less than 1,000 steps each day, which was challenging for her family. Her parents and friends, as well as medical experts, were perplexed as to why she would willingly do this to her body and cautioned her against it. She transformed into someone she didn't know as a result of her weight gain, becoming weak, despondent, and vulnerable.</p><p>Katie signed up for this expecting it to be a physical procedure. However, it turned out to be a far more emotional voyage. She has been through two weddings without crying and three babies without crying. She doesn't weep easily, but her weight gain caused her to cry a lot since she transformed into someone she was not. Hopkins realized that being big is very difficult.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/09/katie-hopkins-weight-gain-before-after.jpg alt="Katie Hopkins before and after weight gain. celebsindepth.com" width=1279 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Katie Hopkins before and after weight gain.<br>Source: People</strong></p><p>She was exacerbated by the fact that she had to keep the show a secret, so she had no explanation for why she was suddenly gaining weight. Many people believed she was pregnant, and she was even sent flowers and offered seats on the metro. Hopkins ingested 504,000 calories in total — enough for two adults and a small kid — and weighed <strong>167 pounds</strong> at the conclusion of the 12 weeks, a rise of <strong>43 pounds</strong> from her beginning weight.</p><p>The media personality ate every two hours to gain weight for the program, devouring fatty and sugary drinks, junk food, and candy. She had a full English breakfast, which included sausage, bacon, a fried egg, hash potatoes, fried bread, and chocolate milk. She had macadamia nuts and a croissant for her second breakfast. She had 1/2 Pringles and 1 Coca-Cola can for 12 p.m. munchies. Hopkins had dairy milk, 1/2 liter chocolate milk, and a chicken, bacon, and mayonnaise sandwich on white bread for her midday snack.</p><p>She used to drink 1/2 liters of chocolate milk and eat a chocolate bar at 4 p.m. The mother of three had fish, fries, peas, a 1/2 pint of lemonade, and chocolate cake with heavy cream for supper. She had tea, 12 cans of Pringles, cheese on toast, and 1 liter of chocolate milk for a late-night snack at 8 p.m. At last, we can say that Katie Hopkins took on the challenge of weight gain to prove that overweight individuals are solely responsible for their weight gain.</p><h2>Who Exactly Is Katie Hopkins’ Husband Mark Cross?</h2><p><strong>Katie Hopkins'</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>husband</a>, <strong>Mark Cross</strong> is a talent academy director and design manager. Hopkins and Mark originally met in 2006 while working together at the Met Office.&nbsp;Mark was still married to his first wife <strong>Ruth</strong> after a seven-year marriage.
