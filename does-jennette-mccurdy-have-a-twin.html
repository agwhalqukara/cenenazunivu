Who could ever forget her role as Sam Puckett in the Nickelodeon show&nbsp;iCarly?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jennette McCurdy does not have a twin in real life. She is the youngest of four children and she has three older brothers.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_106786847.jpg><p>People often wonder if Jennette McCurdy has a twin IRL probably because she portrayed fictional twins Melanie and Sam Puckett in&nbsp;Sam & Cat. Now let’s have a look at Jennette’s family life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Difficult Childhood</h2><p>Jennette’s childhood was far from perfect and she claims to have been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">abused</a>&nbsp;physically and emotionally by her mom. She says, her mom was obsessed with making her a star; at 6, she could remember being dragged to different auditions.</p><p>The&nbsp;Sam & Cat&nbsp;actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals</a>,&nbsp;“My mom had always dreamt of being a famous actor and she became obsessed with making me a star.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>When typical 10-year-olds would play outside and hang out with friends, Jennette would be bleaching her hair and whitening her teeth. That didn’t do much for the young actress’ self-esteem. Then a year later, she would start calorie counting to keep her weight down.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Behind the Fame</h2><p>At age 14, McCurdy lands a role in the sitcom&nbsp;iCarly&nbsp;with Miranda Cosgrove as her quirky best friend. The whole cast, though just merely kids acting like adults, developed a certain closeness that resembles a real family.&nbsp;</p><p>During this time, little did everyone know that she had an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eating disorder</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anorexia nervosa</a>, which later developed into binge eating and then&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bulimia</a>. Her spiral down was largely attributed to her desire to keep her mom happy and to keep the peace.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But she later admits in her podcast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Empty Inside</a>, that acting was very difficult for her and that she only did it to help out the family financially. She, later on, explains why she has quit her acting career:</p><p>“I initially didn’t want to do it. My mom put me in it when I was 6 and by sort of age, I guess, 10 or 11, I was the main financial support for my family. My family didn’t have a lot of money, and this was the way out, which I actually think was helpful in driving me to some degree of success.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reluctant Child Stars</h2><p>Her story is not unique in Hollywood. Many showbiz parents push their youngsters to the spotlight for a handful of reasons. Ego-boost, unrealized dreams and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">financial gains</a>&nbsp;are the usual culprits.</p><p>Most child stars are too young to even decide for themselves when they are made to model, act, or appear in commercials.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of them achieve career highs that a typical child their age could only dream of. But behind the glamour usually hides resentment and deep emotional trauma. We’ve seen it happen to countless child stars who have had a level of success too much too soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>We remember the likes of Shia LaBeouf, Lindsay Lohan, and Drew Barrymore as very successful child stars, who were eventually corrupted by the trappings of fame. They were criticized heavily for “behaving badly,” with very little attention given to their deep personal struggles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Choosing Herself</h2><p>In Jennette’s case, she decided to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quit acting</a>&nbsp;for her mental health and peace of mind. Though many advised against it, she was able to stand her ground and concentrated on writing and directing instead. In March 2021, she announced that she won’t be joining the much-awaited&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iCarly&nbsp;revival</a>.</p><p>In 2018, Jennette made her directorial debut via the short film,&nbsp;Kenny, which she also wrote. Since then, she followed it up with three more shorts:&nbsp;The Grave,&nbsp;The McCurdys,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Strong Independent Women.&nbsp;</p><p>Her acting hiatus was placed on hold when in 2020 she created and acted on her very own tragicomedy show titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a>. The show ran in both New York and Los Angeles but had to stop due to the coronavirus pandemic. The show resumed in September 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As if her schedule isn’t hectic enough, Jennette added author to her list of credentials. Her memoir,&nbsp;I’m Glad My Mom Died, is a humorous take on her struggles as a former child star and her complicated relationship with her overbearing mother.</p><p>In it, she chronicles the joys, as well as the pain of fame. She bravely recounts issues like addictions, eating disorders, anxiety, shame, and bad relationships that plagued her while living the dream of her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>But more importantly, this memoir talks about how Jennette embarks on her recovery and how she decides for the first time in her life what she truly wants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdn7KvusStq55lnZiwtr7DsmShmaaaeqJ507Cgp2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-twin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-twin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-twin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-twin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-twin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-twin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./folorunsho-alakija-age-children-husband-education-books-cars-house-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./folorunsho-alakija-age-children-husband-education-books-cars-house-net-worth.html>Folorunsho Alakija age, children, husband, education, books, cars, house, net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./begam-jaffry-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-career-wiki.html>Begam jaffry - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Career, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./begam-jaffry-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-career-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
